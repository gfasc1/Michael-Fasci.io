To live is to fail and to learn. At my core I consider myself an increadibly curious person. When I look at the world I see nothing but questions and problems to figure out and solve. This is what excites me and pushes me to improve and grow. When I decied to study bioeningeering it started from a plac of indecision. I believed that the world was far too vast to try and limit myself. Biology seemed so infinite complex and beauiful and mathmatics and physics seemed so grounded and practical. I could pick what I wanted to focus on until I found out about bioengineering.
