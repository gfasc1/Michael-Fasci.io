Hello! I’m Michael, a 3rd year at Washington State University majoring in bioengineering. I am passionate about learning about biology and finding relevent solutions to improving the way we conduct science and am actively seeking research opportunities to contribute to meaningful projects while expanding my academic and professional skills.

<b>Academic Background</b>
<br><u>Institution:<u/> Michael Fasci

<u>Major:</u> Bioeningeering

<u>Expected Graduation:</u> May 2027


<b>Research Experience</b>
<br>Undergrad volenteer – Dr.Driskell's skin regeneration and fibroblast lab | August 2023 - Present

This summer I have been expanding a hair computer vision model by increasing the number of species that the model could detect. To do this, I needed to be able to quickly annotate images to train the model on. I created a tool which takes imaged microscope slides and segments them into tiles which can then be rapidly annotated using my application. With this I was able to quickly train a new model for mouse, cat, pig, and rabbit hair. However, to increase the quality of the model, better images and more replicates were needed.  To decrease the time and effort needed to take a single high-resolution image of a slide on the lab’s Nikon Eclipse E600, I started a project to motorize it for automatic imaging. I am currently designing and getting the parts to create my first prototype and will soon start assembly and testing.


<b>Conferences & Presentations</b>
<br>Attended: Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minoritized Scientists (ABRCMS) | 2024 | Pittsburg, PA

Gave a poster presentation my work titled “Creating the world’s largest mammalian hair database to create a new health diagnostic tool.”

<u>Upcoming/Planned:</u> ABRCMS 2025, San Antonio, TX

<b>Skills & Technical Proficiencies</b>
<br><u>Laboratory/Research:</u> I am trained in histology and microscopy, and data analysis

<u>Computational:</u> I am proficient in python, R, MATLAB, C++, computer vision, and computer learning.


<b>Extracurriculars & Leadership</b>
<br>BJJ Club: Secretary | August 2024 - Present
Country Swing Danse Club: Treasuer | August 2025 - Present
